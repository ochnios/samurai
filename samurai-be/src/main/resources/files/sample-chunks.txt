## Flash Floods in Spain
At least 62 people have died in southeastern Spain due to flash floods, with Valencia experiencing its worst rainfall
in 28 years. The floods, which occurred on October 29, 2024, have caused significant damage, sweeping away cars and
tearing down walls. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has pledged full support for the victims, while the regional
government has urged residents to avoid travel. The floods are attributed to a "cold drop," a weather phenomenon
causing intense rainfall.

## Russia Claims Control of Selydove
The Russian Defense Ministry announced on October 29, 2024, that it had taken control of the Ukrainian town of
Selydove, located southeast of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region. This development is part of Russia's ongoing assault and
incremental territorial gains in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities have not yet commented on Russia's claims. The
capture of Selydove is significant as it was an important staging area for Ukraine's defenses and a key foothold to
prevent Russia's advance toward Pokrovsk.

# Scrambled eggs
1. Crack the Eggs: Crack 2-3 eggs into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.
2. Whisk: Beat the eggs until the whites and yolks are fully combined, creating a smooth, slightly bubbly mix.
3. Preheat the Pan: Place a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat and add a small knob of butter or a splash of oil.
Let it melt, coating the pan.
4. Cook: Pour the eggs into the pan. Stir gently with a spatula, scraping the bottom to fold the eggs as they cook.
5. Remove Early: When the eggs look just set but still a bit soft, take the pan off the heat. The residual heat will
finish cooking them.
6. Serve: Enjoy immediately, adding extra salt, pepper, or herbs if you like!

# Habits
## Creating good habits
- Make it obvious: Design your environment to trigger your habit. For example, place a water bottle on your desk if you
want to drink more water.
- Make it attractive: Pair your habit with something enjoyable (e.g., listen to a podcast while exercising). This helps
create a craving for the habit.
- Make it easy: Reduce friction and simplify the habit to its easiest form. Start small, like doing one push-up or
reading one page.
- Make it satisfying: Reinforce the habit with an immediate reward, like tracking your progress. Celebrating small wins
helps build consistency.

# Habits
## Getting Rid of Bad Habits
- Make it invisible: Remove triggers from your environment. If you want to cut back on social media, keep your phone in
a different room.
- Make it unattractive: Reframe the habit to focus on the negative aspects. For instance, think about how unhealthy
snacks affect your energy and health.
- Make it difficult: Increase friction by adding steps. For example, if you want to cut back on TV, unplug it after each
 use.
- Make it unsatisfying: Add an immediate consequence or accountability partner. Telling someone your goal or creating a
cost for failure can discourage the habit.
